### Connected Brain Regions (SMT-Neurophysiology)
SMT-Neurophysiology is a web-based tool to find connectivity between a given set of brain regions. Specifically, this tool uses a Steiner Minimal Tree approximation algorithm to find the best connections between the brain regions.

### Installing SMT-Neurophysiology
Please do the following steps to install the SMT-Neurophysiology in your workspace:

- `git clone https://github.com/dewancse/connected-brain-regions.git`
- Open `index.html` home page in the browser

### SMT-Neurophysiology workflow
This tool consists of two panel: `left panel` shows some brain regions and `right panel` visualizes a given set of brain regions. The user will select some brain regions of interest on the `left panel` and the `right panel` will show the connectivity of the selected brain regions.
